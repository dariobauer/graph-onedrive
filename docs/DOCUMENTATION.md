## General

### Azure app creation

Before the package can interact with the Graph API, it must first create an authenticated session with the Microsoft identity platform.

The Graph API operates securely through each request having an accompanying bearer token containing an "access token". These tokens are used to verify a session has been authenticated.
The package generates these access tokens on your behalf, acting as a native OAuth client.

Note that some Microsoft work and school accounts will not allow apps to connect with them without admin consent.

#### Step 1: Create an Azure app

To interact with the Graph API, an app needs to be registered through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Detailed documentation on how to do this is [available directly from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2?context=graph%2Fapi%2F1.0&view=graph-rest-1.0).

Setup Option | Description
---|---
Supported account types | This is related to the tenant described in the next section. Essentially the more restrictive, the easier it is to get the app registered.
Redirect URI | It is recommended this is left as `Web` to `http://localhost`.

#### Step 2: Obtain authentication details

You need to obtain your registered app's authentication details from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to use in the package for authentication.

Parameter | Location within Azure Portal | Description
---|---|---
Directory (tenant) ID | App registrations > *your app name* > Overview | The tenant is used to restrict an app to certain accounts. `common` allows both personal Microsoft accounts as well as work/school accounts to use the app. `organizations`, and `consumers` each only allow these account types. All of these types are known as multi-tenant and require more security processes be passed to ensure that you are a legitimate developer. On the contrary, single-tenant apps restrict the app to only one work/school account (i.e. typically one company) and therefore have far fewer security requirements. Single tenants are either a GUID or domain. Refer to the [Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols#endpoints) for details.
Application (client) ID | App registrations > *your app name* > Overview | The application ID that's assigned to your app. You can find this information in the portal where you registered your app. Note that this is not the client secret id but the id of the app itself.
Client secret value | App registrations > *your app name* > Certificates & secrets | The client secret that you generated for your app in the app registration portal. Note that this allows you to set an expiry and should be checked if your app stops working. The client secret is hidden after the initial generation so it is important to copy it and keep it secure.

WARNING: The client secret presents a security risk if exposed. It is recommended to revoke the client secret immediately if it becomes exposed.

### Configuration

Graph-OneDrive requires the Azure app credentials and a few other items of configuration to operate. While these parameters can be input during instance creation, it is instead recommended to use a configuration file.

The configuration details required are below displayed in the typical configuration file format (json).

```json
{
    "onedrive": {
        "tenant_id": "",
        "client_id": "",
        "client_secret_value": "",
        "redirect_url": "http://localhost:8080",
        "refresh_token": null
    }
}
```

Note that the `onedrive` dictionary key can be any string and could facilitate multiple instances running from the same configuration file with different keys.

The `redirect_url` and `refresh_token` values are default so these lines can be removed if you are using the defaults. To learn about the refresh token, refer to the corresponding section in the docs below.

### Installation

#### Requirements

The package currently requires Python 3.7 or greater.

#### Install

Install and update using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) which will use the releases hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/graph-onedrive/#history).
Depending on your installation you may need to use `pip3` instead.

```console
pip install graph-onedrive
```

You can also install the in-development version:

```console
pip install https://github.com/dariobauer/graph-onedrive/archive/main.zip
```

#### Dependencies

The package currently requires [HTTPX](https://pypi.org/project/httpx/), and [aiofiles](https://pypi.org/project/aiofiles/). These will be installed automatically if using pip as described above.

## Command-line interface

A command-line interface tool is provided with the typical installation.

You can run the cli using ```graph-onedrive``` or ```python3 -m graph-onedrive```.

```console
graph-onedrive [-h] [-c] [-a] [-i] [-V] [-f PATH] [-k KEY]
```

### Main actions

One of the main actions must be given as an input.

Action argument | Description
---|---
-c, --configure | Create a new configuration file, or add to an existing one with a different dictionary key
-a, --authenticate | Authenticate a configuration file
-i, --instance | Interact with OneDrive to test your config and perform simple tasks

You can combine these to run multiple tasks in succession, with a common one being `graph-onedrive -cai` which will create a config file, authenticate it, and then run an instance.

### Options to input configuration file path and key

You can use flags to specify the config file path and/or dictionary key.

Optional argument | Description
---|---
-f, --file PATH | Optional path to config json file
-k, --key KEY | Optional config file dictionary key

Use these flags by using the flag followed by the input, for example:

```console
graph-onedrive -cai -f "config.json" -k "onedrive"
```

### Other commands

Other arguments | Description
---|---
-V, --version | Returns the version of Graph-Onedrive installed
-h, --help | Displays help, including a list of attributes

## Limitations

### Personal drives only

The Graph API provides hooks to interact with a number of drives connected to an account, including SharePoint.

However the Graph-OneDrive package currently only connects to a user's personal OneDrive, including a user's work personal, or school personal OneDrive.

### Work and school accounts may limit apps

Some Microsoft work and school accounts will not allow apps to connect with them without admin consent.

### Saving refresh tokens for multiple users

The package currently has the option to save refresh tokens for a user. While it is possible to create multiple instances with a different user for each instance, it is not possible to use a single config file for multiple users.

It is however possible to use one config file to host multiple configurations within itself by using the dictionary key described in the config file section.

### Throttling limits

TLDR; for file transfer methods keep max_connections â‰¤ 16

Depending on your internet connection and the sizes of the files that you and transferring may see increased transfer speeds with more connections than the default. Graph-OneDrive currently will create a new connection for every 1MiB if not limited by the max_connections. If you have a really fast connection having many connections may slow the overall performance.

A word of caution on too many connections - the Graph API may throttle requests. This can be a hard throttle where all existing connections are cut and a cool-down period is enforced.
Throttling can be applied at the user level or the whole organization. [Details on throttling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/throttling) are available, however the [exact limits are not provided](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/throttling).

We recommended to not exceed 16 connections for performance and to avoid throttling.

## Package use

### Package import

```python
import graph_onedrive
```

### Creating an OneDrive instance

Graph-OneDrive is an object-orientated package that uses an OneDrive class allowing you to create multiple instances of that class.

To create an instance, you need to provide the configuration.

#### a) Using a config file (recommended)

Refer above section on configuration to learn about config files.

```python
config_path = "config.json"  # path to config file
config_key = "onedrive"  # cofig file dictionary key (default = "onedrive")
my_instance = graph_onedrive.create_from_config_file(config_path, config_key)
```

#### b) Using in-line configuration parameters

This solution is slightly easier but could be a security issue, especially if sharing code.

```python
client_id = ""
client_secret_value = ""
tenant = ""
redirect_url = "http://localhost:8080"
my_instance = graph_onedrive.create(
    client_id, client_secret_value, tenant, redirect_url
)
```

### Authenticating the instance

The instance must be authenticated by a user giving their delegated permission for your project to interact with the Graph API.

#### a) Authenticate at the time of instance initialization

The easiest option is to just create an instance as per above methods. A prompt will appear in the command line for you to copy a url to a web browser, authenticate, and then copy the redirected url back into the terminal.

#### b) Authenticate the config file in the command-line

You can use a config file to authenticate in the command line ahead of instance creation which is useful if your production code will not be run in a terminal. This will save a refresh token (described in the next section) to your config file.

```console
graph-onedrive -a
```

WARNING: This configuration assumes that your use of the configuration file serves one user only. If using the same code to serve multiple users then the refresh token must be stored independently of the configuration file.

### Using refresh tokens

Access tokens used to authenticate each request directly by the Graph API, without having to re-authenticate each time with the authentication server which speeds up requests. However due to security, these tokens typically expire after one hour.
To avoid having to have the user re-authorize the app with their account, refresh tokens are used instead. This process of refreshing access tokens in managed automatically by the package, however if the script ends, then the instance information is lost.

To use the refresh token to create a new instance (e.g. after running the script again), you can save the refresh token and provide it at the time of instance initiation.

WARNING: Saving the refresh token presents a security risk as it could be used by anyone with it exchange it for an access token. If a refresh token is exposed, it is recommended that the app client secret it revoked.

#### Obtaining the refresh token

##### a) Saving to a config file

If using a configuration file then you can have the helper functions save the refresh token to your configuration. Simply add the following call after your last API request.

```python
graph_onedrive.save_to_config_file(my_instance, config_path, config_key="onedrive")
```

Then when creating the instance again using your config file, the refresh token will be used.

WARNING: This configuration assumes that your use of the configuration file serves one user only. If using the same code to serve multiple users then the refresh token must be stored independently of the configuration file.

##### b) Saving the token manually

You can get the refresh token from your instance:

```python
refresh_token = my_instance.refresh_token
```

Then when creating an instance later, provide the refresh token:

```python
my_instance = graph_onedrive.create(..., refresh_token=refresh_token)
```
